## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I've successfully created and implemented the TodoApp project constitution based on the template and project context. The constitution includes six core principles:
1. SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
2. REUSABLE INTELLIGENCE
3. CLEAN CODE STANDARDS
4. DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING
5. TEST-FIRST APPROACH
6. ARCHITECTURAL GOVERNANCE

Along with sections for Security Requirements, Development Workflow, and Governance.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive project constitution with 6 core principles and governance sections
- 🧪 Tests: N/A for this governance document
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Users can now reference the constitution for development guidance
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution aligns with the project's Spec-Driven Development approach
